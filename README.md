Medication Reminder Sample App
==============================

This app reminds individuals or their caregivers of upcoming and missed medications.

The view defaults to the current date. All medications for the selected day are displayed and ordered by time.

Beginning 5 minutes prior to medication time, a button will be enabled to mark the medication as completed.

At medication time there will be a chime sound and alert of which medication to take along with the dosage.

5 minutes after medication time there will be a louder, more annoying sound and the medication will be marked as missed.

There should be a visual indicator to differentiate between an upcoming medication, one that should be taken within +/-5 mins and one that has been missed.
